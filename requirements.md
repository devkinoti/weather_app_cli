## Requirements for Python CLI App: Weather Fetcher


1. Core Functionality

- Fetch current weather data for a user-provided city.
- Display key weather details:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

2. API Integration

- Use a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve weather data.
Support for API key configuration to authenticate requests.
Handle API errors (e.g., invalid API key, city not found, rate limiting).

3. User Interaction

- Accept the city name as input from the command line.
Display an error message if the input is invalid or the city is not found.

4. Data Presentation
- Format and display weather data in a user-friendly manner, including:
  Temperature in Celsius and/or Fahrenheit.

- Humidity as a percentage.
- Descriptive weather condition (e.g., "clear sky", "light rain").
- Optionally display additional information, such as wind speed or pressure.

5. Optional File Saving
- Provide a command-line option to save the fetched weather report to a file.
- Save the report in a user-specified file format (e.g., TXT or JSON).
- Include file naming conventions or a default naming scheme (e.g., weather_<city>.txt).

6. Error Handling

Graceful handling of:
- Invalid or missing API responses.
- Network connectivity issues.
- Invalid user input.
- File I/O errors when saving the report.

7. Configuration Options
Allow optional customization through a configuration file or environment variables:
- API key.
- Preferred temperature unit (Celsius/Fahrenheit).
- Default output file location (if saving enabled).

8. Usability Enhancements

- Provide a --help or -h option to display usage instructions.
Allow optional command-line flags for common actions:
--save: Save the weather report to a file.
--unit: Specify the temperature unit (e.g., --unit=C for Celsius).

9. Logging and Debugging

Log errors or warnings to a separate log file for troubleshooting.
Include a verbose mode (--verbose) for debugging purposes, showing raw API responses or additional details.

10. Platform Compatibility

Ensure the program runs on major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) with Python 3.x.

11. Extensibility

Design the code to support future features, such as:
- Fetching weather for multiple cities in a single command.
- Forecast data (e.g., 7-day weather outlook).
- Localization support for displaying weather descriptions in different languages.
