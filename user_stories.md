### Core Features
- As a user, I want to input a city name and see the current weather details, so that I can quickly know the weather in my location of interest.

- As a user, I want the app to display the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit, so that I can view the weather in my preferred unit.
As a user, I want to see the humidity and a brief weather description (e.g., sunny, rainy), so that I can understand the overall weather conditions.

### API Integration
- As a developer, I want to configure the app with an API key for authentication, so that I can securely fetch weather data.

- As a user, I want the app to notify me if there are issues retrieving weather data (e.g., invalid city, network error), so that I know when and why the app isn’t working.

### File Saving
- As a user, I want the option to save the weather report to a file, so that I can keep a record of the weather for future reference.

- As a user, I want to specify the format (e.g., TXT or JSON) and file name when saving the weather report, so that I can organize and access saved reports easily.

### Usability
- As a user, I want the app to provide clear instructions when I use a --help option, so that I can understand how to use the app.

- As a user, I want to use command-line flags (e.g., --save, --unit) for quick and efficient operation, so that I can get results without extra prompts.

### Error Handling
- As a user, I want to receive an error message if I input an invalid city name, so that I can correct it and try again.

- As a user, I want the app to handle API errors gracefully (e.g., city not found, invalid API key), so that I’m not confused or frustrated when something goes wrong.

### Configuration and Customization

- As a developer, I want the app to support environment variables for configuration (e.g., API key, default temperature unit), so that I can simplify setup and operation.

- As a user, I want to configure my preferred temperature unit (Celsius/Fahrenheit) in advance, so that I don’t have to specify it every time.

### Extensibility

- As a user, I want the app to support fetching weather for multiple cities at once, so that I can compare weather conditions across locations.

- As a user, I want the app to offer options for extended forecasts (e.g., 7-day outlook), so that I can plan ahead.

- As a user, I want to specify the language for weather descriptions, so that I can view the output in my preferred language.

### Logging and Debugging
- As a user, I want the app to log errors and warnings to a separate file, so that I can troubleshoot issues if needed.

- As a developer, I want the app to include a verbose mode (--verbose) that displays raw API responses, so that I can debug issues during development or testing.

### Platform Compatibility
As a user, I want the app to work seamlessly on my platform (Windows, macOS, Linux), so that I can use it regardless of my operating system.
